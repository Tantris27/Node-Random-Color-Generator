# Node-Random-Color-Generator

## Short Node Program

1.When somebody enters a specific command in the command line, a block of approximately 31x9 # characters and of a random color(hex) will be generated.
2.It should be able to not only accept the command itself, but also the request for a hue, luminosity and then generate random colors that match those choices.
3.If a user types "ask" instead of a color name, print questions to ask the user for the name of the color and the luminosity. 4. If a user types a size in the format of WWxHH (eg. 31x9) before the color and luminosity, it will use this as the size of the box.
